# Let's Learn MCP with Python - Tutorial Series

A comprehensive guide to understanding and building Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers for Python developers through interactive learning experiences.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this tutorial series, you'll have:

1. **🐍 Python Study Buddy App** - An interactive console application that uses a custom MCP server to help developers learn Python concepts at beginner, intermediate, and expert levels
2. **🧠 AI Research Learning MCP Server** - Your own advanced MCP server that helps AI assistants find the latest AI/ML research papers, highlight top discoveries, and create personalized study plans

## Tutorial Structure

## Quick Start

If you're ready to dive in immediately:

### 1. Visual Studio Code
- Download and install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Essential for MCP development and integration

### 2. Python 3.12+
- Install Python 3.12 or later from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Verify installation: `python --version` or `python3 --version`
- Ensure pip is installed: `pip --version` or `pip3 --version`

### 3. Python Extension for VS Code
- Install the [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) extension
- Provides comprehensive Python development support
- Includes IntelliSense, debugging, and virtual environment management

### 4. Install UV
To install UV, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
pip install uv 
```

### 5. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
# Using venv (recommended)
python -m venv mcp-env

# Activate on macOS/Linux
source mcp-env/bin/activate

# Activate on Windows
mcp-env\Scripts\activate
```

### 6. Install packages 

```bash
uv sync --active
```

### 6. Walk through the core concepts in the terminal 

```bash
python part-1-concepts.py
```

### 7. Build your first MCP app
